SPICEWORKS UNOFFICIAL EXTERNAL API
This is a small script to authenticate a user to Spiceworks and then fetch some
JSON API data from their Internal JSON API

It is very simple procedural code that you may want to re-work for your own purposes
I'm going to turn this into a class someday.

Here's the blog post introducing and explaining this script:

Caution: This may break in the future if Spiceworks changes the way they authenticate.
